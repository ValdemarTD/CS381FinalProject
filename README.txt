The name of the language is StackLanguage. As its name implies, it is a stack based language where the stack is a linked list rather than a block of contiguous memory. This feature is notable since it features strings as a primitive data type and natively supports basic file I/O.

WARNING: This program will not compile unless you install Split. Instructions:
cabal install split
